# Learning a full new language and software became quite the challenge
# for a project, and I at times thought I would not make my goal.
# However, with a lot of research and hard work in class, over the 
# course of a few periods I would learn things one by one.
# Things like making a fixed camera movement, making a functioning
# TileMap, even the Main Menu, learning the functionality of button's
# and signal.  Animations and sprites also took me much longer then I 
# thought and I have a much bigger respect for artists and designers
# for games and such.  I would love to continue this project after 
# highschool, and because of this I've made some notes on future goals
# for this game that would be next steps in the game's development.

# Enemies have to be added, as well as a seperate world for the battles
# to commence on

# Stat blocks and inventory would need to be added, checking this will
# be done through the pause menu, and savable through the save file

# More worlds to be added, this is just one

# More animations for combat, possibly being a seperate player class

# Figure out how to make simple dialogue interactions, and from there
# how to make cutscenes in a top down enviroment

# Create a system for having partners to travel with, who'll appear
# in combat alongside you and in the world with you.
